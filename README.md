How does it work?

Roblox servers send requests to the RSSP server via an API to display the screen.

How do I use this API manually?

Simply navigate to yourserver:2037/docs to see the available APIs.

How to use this API?

1) Download the API
and configure the shared/config.py file
2) Run the API via `start.bat` or server.py
3) Configure a port forwarding tool (if necessary), such as pinggy.io
4) Join my place: [Screen Test](https://www.roblox.com/games/98821705891412/Screen-Test) or publish it yourself and join (not available, only in version 2).
5) Open the dashboard and connect to your IP address (the dashboard is in Russian, sorry).
6) Click "Connect."
7) Success.
